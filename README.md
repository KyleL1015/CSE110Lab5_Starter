Check your Understanding
1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

The message feature isn't a simple unit check and involves integration from multiple parts of your "large moving application." You need to get a message from the user, determine if they message fits your specifications, establish a connection between one or many users, and then send that message to others and unit tests won't cut it for that.

2. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters

This is a simple check that does not require integration of the larger application. It is simply a logical test and tests the length of a single message.
